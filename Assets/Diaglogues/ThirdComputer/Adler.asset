  dialogue:
  - Hello old friend.
  - "It's me, Adler\u2026 I helped you with the building. I'm the lumberjack."
  - Don't worry. I made a promise that I would come and buy something.
  - "Hm\u2026 Perhaps you've heard the expression \u201CIf you're afraid of the wolves,
    don't go into the woods?\u201D"
  - "Well, when I ventured into the forest, I wasn't afraid of animals, monsters,
    or even getting lost. Corpse-eaters, orcs, or ghosts of the forest. My father
    was a vagabond. Before we settled in this town, we traveled extensively. He taught
    me how to survive and evade monsters. But\u2026 I want to fight with an ent\u2026"
  - Because I don't want to be taken down by a stupid piece of wood. The chance of
    getting attacked by an ent is low, but never zero. I just want to fight. I'll
    take on an ent barehanded.
