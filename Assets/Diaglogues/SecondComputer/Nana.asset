  dialogue:
  - Yes. Hello.
  - My name is Nana, a guard's archer.
  - Thank you. One of them is natural, the other - is an illusion. I lost them during
    the Siege of Snowgrad.
  - Indeed, it was. But I'm here for a different reason today.
  - I need potions that can help me see the face from the past...
  - The killer of my friend. When the battle for Snowgard began, we were in the camp.
    They attacked us from behind like cowards. I remember perfectly how he looked,
    but the face... I couldn't remember.
