  - And what about your friend Scott? When is he due?
  - But I thought my last potion was splendid.
  - Oh dear... My apologies. Perhaps I erred with one of the mushrooms. Let's hope
    he doesn't increase his prices for me.
  - Trust me, Roach, my heart belongs to my craft, not to any hero. Anyway, I need
    to gather some mushrooms. Can you assist me?
  - No problem, I'll manage.
  - "Soo\u2026. The new client."
  - Hello. So, how can I help you?
  - Nice cat ears. They're quite unique.
  - I see... That must have been a harrowing experience.
  - Of course. What do you need?
  - Whose face are you trying to recall?
  - "I understand. It's a painful memory. Let me think\u2026 "
  - 'I think it can be called "Lacrimosa." '
