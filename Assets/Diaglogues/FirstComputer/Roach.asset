  dialogue:
  - Good m*oink*rning. How are you?
  - Same here. Have you heard? One of the Heroes is heading our way. Artur the Rock.
    You might want to check your mail.
  - Yes, and you ought to prepare for his arrival. You once confessed your admiration
    for him.
  - ' Unfortunately, he wont come today. And for future please, refrain from trying
    to sell him anything.'
  - Unfortunately, he had a dream involving a colossal flapper attempting to end
    him. As for the spider, it was a downright nightmare.
  - I'll swing by later. Farewell for now.
