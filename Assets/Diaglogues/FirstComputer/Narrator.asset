  dialogue:
  - In a quaint country, nestled within a sleepy town, there resides Elster - the
    enigmatic mushroom witch. Her specialty lies in granting people visions of their
    deepest desires, a phenomenon known as "Mushrommantia" according to local lore.
    Our tale begins on a seemingly ordinary day when Roach, a talking pig and dear
    friend of Elster's, waddled into her cozy shop.
