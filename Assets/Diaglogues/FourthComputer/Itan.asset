  - "Hello\u2026"
  - Can I explain the situation... But promise not to laugh?
  - Alright... So... I'm working on this project about the lives of kings, and I
    need a dream where I can experience being a king.
  - ' I want it to involve harems, grand banquets, epic battles... You know, all
    the extravagant stuff. I want to truly immerse myself in the power and luxury
    of being a king.'
  - Whitestone University.
  - Will do. So, are you willing to help me with my project?
  - Thank you, Miss Elster. I'll return later to take it.
